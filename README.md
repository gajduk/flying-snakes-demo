Flying snakes demo
========================

Watch the snakes fly on the screen and be amazed.

You can change the number of snakes through the constructor, for large numbers ~500 it looks like fireworks :).

----

The snakes' movements are governed by the [random waypoint model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_waypoint_model),
which can guarantee that the snakes remain within the screen bounds, contrary to Brownian motion, where snakes usually wander off after a while.
In fact, the whole thing started as an experiment to test different random movement models.
